        <h2>RideShare App</h2>
        <h3>Frontend Developer, Swift</h3>
        <p class="proj-p">

            In April of 2024, I worked for 24 hours alongside 3 backend developers to create a app that connects users to a ride in their local area with other Cornell students. My role included creating multiple navigable screens and implementing network calls from the frontend to the backend by using Swift. </p>

        <h2>Magnificent Komodo Dragon Game</h2>
        <h3>Developer, OCaml</h3>
        <p class="proj-p">

            This game is a choose-your-own-adventure graphical interface game in OCaml using the Raylib library. A player will enter their name and make choices throughout the story that influence their ending. The player will encounter many scenarios and interact with different entities, occasionally gaining attacks they can use in their final boss battle against one of 3 bosses. After the boss battle, a player will receive one of six endings based on their previously accumulated points and their performance during the boss battle.</p>

        <h2>Raycaster</h2>
        <h3>Programmer, C</h3>

        <p class="proj-p">

            For my Computer Systems and Organization class, our final project was creating a raycaster in C. I implemented a raycasting algorithm in C by developing sequential and multithreaded versions using POSIX threads. I also designed and executed performance experiments varying parameters such as image size, light count, and thread count, producing analytical plots and a written report that explained scalability tradeoffs and bottlenecks. Finally, I built test cases to validate correctness of implementations, ensuring reliable output for both sequential and parallel approaches. </p>

        <h2>Space Invaders</h2>
        <h3>Programmer, Python</h3>

        <p class="proj-p">

            In December of 2023, my final project for my Intro to Computing class was creating a "Space Invaders" game where a player "shoots" down different aliens by moving their plane around. The player either wins the game when they defeat all of the aliens or loses the game when they lose all of their lives. I also added "mega-aliens" that had multiple lives. This game was created with a graphical interface in Python. </p>
