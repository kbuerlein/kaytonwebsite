    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
            Growing up in Richmond, I became very fond of the great outdoors. I spend most of my free time at home hanging out outside: whether that be laying in my backyard with a friend, out on a hike in the Blue Ridge Mountains, or taking my dog on a walk. I'm also a huge foodie, and love trying new restaurants, foods, and recipes. I even co-own a food-centered Instagram account!

            At school, you can always find me studying in a café. Coffee is one of the many things I am very passionate about, and I find it is something that is especially delicious when paired with an almond croissant (my number one on-campus recommendation would be Temple of Zeus).
        </p>

        <h2>Kayton's current coffee pairings:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Caramel macchiato (hot) with a double chocolate muffin</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Iced coffee with half & half along with a sausage breakfast sandwich (preferably from Mattin's Café in Duffield)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Iced mocha with raspberry cold foam and a chocolate chip bagel with strawberry cream cheese</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Iced vanilla latte with an almond croissant</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I would call myself a people person. If you go on a walk with me, there is a very high chance that I will run into someone I know. Part of this is due to the numerous organizations I am a part of on campus. </p>

        <p> I am involved in Women in Computing at Cornell as an active member and mentor, Mediocre Melodies a-capella as president, Kappa Theta Pi pre-professional techology fraternity as VP of Marketing, and Tri Delta sorority as a member of the philanthropy team. When I am at home, I work at a local elementary school as a substitute teacher in their after school care program. I love being involved on campus, and I am thankful for all the opportunities that Cornell has given me to meet and befriend so many people.</p>

        <p>Speaking of Cornell, I am currently a second year student pursuing a degree in computer science and a minor in business. I'm mainly interested in frontend programming and software engineering, but am also passionate about artificial intelligence (and ethics surrounding it), UI and UX design, and video game creation. </p>

        <p>At Cornell and in my free time, I have learned Python, Java, OCaml, Swift, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also used GitHub, VSCode, IntelliJ, and Pulsar as different coding platforms. </p>
